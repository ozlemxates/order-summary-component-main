This is a solution to the [Order summary card challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/order-summary-component-QlPmajDUj).

## What I used
-CSS
-HTML 

### Continued development
 While designing this project I used CSS and HTML basics, most of which are margins and paddings. In future I might change the soluture to make it shorter and to get rid of the lines might be unnecesarry.
